		# DESCRIPTION #
		---------------
		Attempts to create a Portmanteau out of the two inputs words
		If successful, returns the Portmanteau
		If unnsuccessful, returns None along with a descriptive error message

		Two words can be combined into a portmanteau if:
		1) the phonemes at the tail of one word are in close phonetric proximity the phonemes at the head of the other word
		2) the phoneme overlap is at least 2 phones long
		3) the phoneme overlap contains at least 1 vowel
		4) the overlap does not comprise either of the entire words
		5) the overlapping phones can be brought into alignment with their corresponding graphemes

		See paper for details
